PySpark provides many levels of logging, from nothing at all to a full description of everything happening on the cluster. The `pyspark` shell defaults on `WARN`, which can be a little chatty when we’re learning. More importantly, a non-interactive PySpark program (which is how you’ll run your scripts for the most part) defaults to the oversharing `INFO` level.

PySpark provides not one, but two identical methods to perform this task. You can use either `.filter()` or its alias `.where()`. This duplication is to ease the transition for users coming from other data-processing engines or libraries; some use one, some the other. PySpark provides both, so no arguments are possible! I prefer `filter()`, because `w` maps to more data frame methods (`withColumn()` in chapter 4 or `withColumnRenamed()` in chapter 3).
